# Understandable RayTracing in 256 lines of bare C++

This repository is a support code for my computer graphics lectures. It is not meant to be the ultimate rendering code or even physically realistic. It is meant to be **simple**. This project is distributed under the [DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO PUBLIC LICENSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL).

**Check [the wiki](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki) that accompanies the source code. The second raytracing chapter is available [in the tinykaboom repository](https://github.com/ssloy/tinykaboom/wiki). If you are looking for a software rasterizer, check the [other part of the lectures](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki).**

In my lectures I tend to avoid third party libraries as long as it is reasonable, because it forces to understand what is happening under the hood. So, the raytracing 256 lines of plain C++ give us this result:
